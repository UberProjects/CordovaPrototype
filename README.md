A simple prototype exploring the various features of Cordova for eventual use for a social layer on top of uber.


When adding a new feature please create a new branch based off of dev and when you are read to commit it submit a pull request to master for review for large changes. After that merge with dev. When we feel we have reached a mile stone dev will be merged into master and dev will be reset. At which point all ongoing work will need to be rebased. This is called the branch per feature method.
